 Project: 4x4 tic-tac-toe simulation
 Purpose:  Allow two usersto play 4x4 Tic-Tac-Toe..
 Due date: November 25th, 2020

Testing: To test the program, we first verified the validity of the input. For example, we entered values of 1 through 16 to ensure the program accepted them. We also entered values of zero and numbers of 17 or greater to make sure the program rejected those values. Furthermore, we tested the program to ensure it would not allow the user to enter a value into an already occupied box. We did so through entering in values repeatedly into the same cell to test the program. We also tested the spacing of the matrix through running multiple iterations of the program and altering the format after each time. Verification of the win conditions involved going through each case (win for x, win for o, tie) and ensuring that the program would correctly recognize and tally each case to output at the end of the session.
 
Limitations : One limitation of the program would be the range of inputs. For example, if anthing other than an integer is entered when the user is asked to enter a number from 1 to 16, the program will not run correctly.

void fourxfour(string boxes[4][4]);

//This function has void output.
//The task of this function is to print the array in a 4*4 square matrix form.

//Input: An array of strings of [4][4] size, x, o, and tie
//input x,o, and tie to maintain tally of x score, o score, and tie score across all games.
//This function has void output.

void print_func(string boxes[4][4]);
//Input: An array of strings of [4][4] size.
//This function has void output.
//The task of this function is to print the new matix in which play function has replaced
//an element with "X" or "O". Need for a different print funcion other than fourxfour arises
//due to formatting difference.

void switcheroo (string& xor_knot);
//Input: A string variable with either the value "X" or "O".
//This function has void output.
//The task of this function is to switch between players (switched between "X" and "O".

// Input: x, o, tie.
//pass in x, o, and tie to maintain tally of score in previous games.
//The task of the function is to start the game.

//Input: An array of string of [4][4] size and an integer recieved from players (the spot they want to play on).
//The function has void output.
//The function checks if the spot the player wants to move on is legal or not.
//It checks if number is between 1 and 16 and checks if the spot has already not been used.

//Input: An array of strings of [4][4] size.
//Output: string that corresponds to the status of the game (x player win, O player win, a tie or no winner yet(i.e. continue the game)).
